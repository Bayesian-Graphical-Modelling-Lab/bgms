**Bayesian analysis of graphical models with binary and ordinal variables**

The **bgms** package implements Bayesian estimation and model comparison for
**ordinal Markov random fields (MRFs)**, graphical models that represent
networks of binary and/or ordinal variables [@MarsmanVandenBerghHaslbeck_2024].
The likelihood is approximated with a pseudolikelihood, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to sample from the corresponding pseudoposterior
distribution of the model parameters.

## Main functions

The package has two main entry points:

- `bgm()` – estimates a single network in a one-sample design.  
- `bgmCompare()` – compares networks between groups in an independent-sample
  design [see @MarsmanWaldorpSekulovskiHaslbeck_2024].

## Effect selection

Both functions support **effect selection** with spike-and-slab priors:

- **Edges in one-sample designs**:  
  `bgm()` models the presence or absence of edges between variables. Posterior
  inclusion probabilities indicate the plausibility of each edge and can be
  converted into Bayes factors for conditional independence tests [see @MarsmanVandenBerghHaslbeck_2024; @SekulovskiEtAl_2024].

- **Communities/clusters in one-sample designs**:  
  `bgm()` can also model community structure. Posterior probabilities for the
  number of clusters quantify the plausibility of clustering solutions and can
  be converted into Bayes factors [see @SekulovskiEtAl_2025].

- **Group differences in independent-sample designs**:  
  `bgmCompare()` models differences in edge weights and category thresholds
  between groups. Posterior inclusion probabilities indicate the plausibility
  of parameter differences and can be converted into Bayes factors for tests of
  parameter equivalence [see @MarsmanWaldorpSekulovskiHaslbeck_2024].

## Why use Markov Random Fields?

Graphical models or networks have become central in recent psychological and psychometric research [@RobinaughEtAl_2020; @MarsmanRhemtulla_2022_SIintro; @ContrerasEtAl_2019]. Most are **Markov random field (MRF)** models, where the graph structure reflects partial associations between variables [@KindermannSnell1980].  

In an MRF, a missing edge between two variables implies **conditional independence** given the rest of the network [@Lauritzen2004]. In other words, the remaining variables fully explain away any potential association between the unconnected pair.

## Why use a Bayesian approach?

When analyzing an MRF, we often want to compare competing hypotheses:

- **Edge presence vs. edge absence** (conditional dependence vs. independence) in one-sample designs.  
- **Parameter difference vs. parameter equivalence** in independent-sample designs.

Frequentist approaches are limited in such comparisons: they can reject a null hypothesis, but they cannot provide evidence *for* it.  
As a result, when an edge or difference is excluded, it remains unclear whether this reflects true absence or simply insufficient power.

Bayesian inference avoids this problem.  
Using **inclusion Bayes factors** [@HuthEtAl_2023_intro; @SekulovskiEtAl_2024], we can quantify evidence in both directions:

- **Evidence of edge presence** vs. **evidence of edge absence**, or  
- **Evidence of parameter difference** vs. **evidence of parameter equivalence**.  

This makes it possible not only to detect structure and group differences, but also to conclude when there is an *absence of evidence*.
