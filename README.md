Bayesian methods for analyzing Markov Random Fields for binary and ordinal variables.

The `R` package **bgms** provides tools for Bayesian analysis of the Markov Random Field (MRF) model for binary and ordinal variables. 

A manuscript describing the details of the Bayesian methods is forthcoming.
