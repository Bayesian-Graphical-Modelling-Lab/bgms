* When a large design is implemented (timepoints>=100) panelmrfsampler sometimes crashes.
** Probably the exponents in the probabilities run away. **Implement a bound.
* Implement na.action
** Create function to compute and simulate from full-conditional: For simulate + impute
* Implement design with fixed thresholds (stationarity assumption)
* Name output columns
* Implement a restmatrix approach to improve speed
