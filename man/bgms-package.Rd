\title{bgms:  Bayesian Graphical Models}
\description{
The \code{R} package \strong{bgms} provides tools for Bayesian analysis of 
graphical models describing networks of variables. The package uses Bayesian 
variable selection methods to model the underlying network structure. 

The package is organized around two Bayesian variable selection approaches: 
(1) EM variable selection \insertCite{RockovaGeorge_2014}{bgms}, and (2) 
Gibbs variable selection \insertCite{GeorgeMcCulloch_1993}{bgms}. The main 
difference between the two approaches is that the former uses EM to search 
for the network structure with the highest posterior probability. While this 
approach is typically very fast, it does not provide information about the 
uncertainty of the estimated network. In contrast, the Gibbs variable 
selection approach builds a Markov chain that explores the full posterior 
distribution of the network structure and associated parameters. While this 
takes considerably more time, its output can be used to compute Bayes factors 
that convey the evidence for including or excluding individual edges in the 
network structure \insertCite{HuthEtAl_2023_intro}{bgms}. 

While the goal is to provide the above tools for Markov Random Field (MRF) 
models for a wide range of variable types in the \strong{bgms} package, it 
currently provides tools for analyzing networks of binary and/or ordinal 
variables \insertCite{MarsmanHaslbeck_2023_OrdinalMRF}{bgms}. MRFs are a 
special class of graphical models whose graph structure reflects the 
conditional associations between their variables. Bayes factor tests on the 
inclusion or exclusion of an edge in the MRF thus compare the conditional 
dependence and conditional independence hypotheses for the corresponding 
network variables \insertCite{MarsmanHaslbeck_2023_OrdinalMRF}{bgms}. 

The \strong{bgms} package offers several tools for analyzing the structure of
the MRF:

\enumerate{
 \item Simulate response data from the MRF using the Gibbs sampler.
 \itemize{
   \item Simulate \code{\link{mrfSampler}}.
 }
 
 \item Estimate the structure of the MRF using EM variable selection. 
 \itemize{
   \item Network estimation with \code{\link{bgm.em}}.
 }
 \item Estimate the posterior distribution of the MRF's network structure 
 using Gibbs variable selection.
 \itemize{
 \item Structure learning with \code{\link{bgm}}.
 }
}

\bold{Additional Features}:

\enumerate{
 
 \item Optimizing the joint pseudolikelihood \code{\link{mple}}.
 
 \item Optimizing the joint pseudoposterior \code{\link{mppe}}.
