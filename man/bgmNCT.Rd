\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or matrix with \code{n} rows and \code{p} columns
containing binary and ordinal variables for \code{n} independent observations
and \code{p} variables in the network. Regular binary and ordinal variables
are recoded as non-negative integers \code{(0, 1, ..., m)} if not already
done. Unobserved categories are collapsed into other categories after
recoding (i.e., if category 1 is unobserved, the data are recoded from
(0, 2) to (0, 1)). Blume-Capel ordinal variables are also coded as
non-negative integers if not already done. However, since ``distance'' to the
reference category plays an important role in this model, unobserved
categories are not collapsed after recoding.}

\item{variable_type}{What kind of variables are there in \code{x}? Can be a
single character string specifying the variable type of all \code{p}
variables at once or a vector of character strings of length \code{p}
specifying the type for each variable in \code{x} separately. Currently, bgm
supports ``ordinal'' and ``blume-capel''. Binary variables are automatically
treated as ``ordinal’’. Defaults to \code{variable_type = "ordinal"}.}

\item{group_indicator}{A vector of length \code{p} that indicates, for each
row in \code{x}, to which of two groups it belongs.}

\item{reference_category}{The reference category in the Blume-Capel model.
Should be an integer within the range of integer scores observed for the
``blume-capel'' variable. Can be a single number specifying the reference
category for all Blume-Capel variables at once, or a vector of length
\code{p} where the \code{i}-th element contains the reference category for
variable \code{i} if it is Blume-Capel, and bgm ignores its elements for
other variable types. The value of the reference category is also recoded
when bgm recodes the corresponding observations. Only required if there is at
least one variable of type ``blume-capel''.}

\item{iter}{How many iterations should the Gibbs sampler run? The default of
\code{1e4} is for illustrative purposes. For stable estimates, it is
recommended to run the Gibbs sampler for at least \code{1e5} iterations.}

\item{burnin}{The number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler before saving its
output. Since it may take some time for the Gibbs sampler to converge to
the posterior distribution, it is recommended not to set this number too low.}

\item{interaction_scale}{The scale of the Cauchy distribution that is used as a
prior for the pairwise interaction parameters. Defaults to \code{2.5}.}

\item{difference_scale}{The scale of the Cauchy distribution that is used as the
prior for the pairwise difference parameters. Defaults to \code{0.1}.}

\item{threshold_alpha, threshold_beta}{The shape parameters of the beta-prime
prior density for the threshold parameters. Must be positive values. If the
two values are equal, the prior density is symmetric about zero. If
\code{threshold_beta} is greater than \code{threshold_alpha}, the
distribution is skewed to the left, and if \code{threshold_beta} is less than
\code{threshold_alpha}, it is skewed to the right. Smaller values tend to
lead to more diffuse prior distributions.}

\item{difference_prior}{The inclusion or exclusion of pairwise differences in
the pairwise interactions between the two groups are modeled with binary
indicator variables. The argument \code{difference_prior} is used to set a
prior distribution for these indicator variables, i.e., the structure of the
network. Currently, two options are implemented: The Bernoulli model
\code{difference_prior = "Bernoulli"} assumes that the probability that there
is a pairwise difference is equal to \code{difference_probability}
and independent of other pairwise differences. When
\code{difference_probability = 0.5}, this means that each possible
configuration of the presence or absence of pairwise differences is given the
same prior weight. The Beta-Bernoulli model
\code{difference_prior = "Beta-Bernoulli"} assumes a beta prior for the unknown
difference probability with shape parameters \code{beta_bernoulli_alpha} and
\code{beta_bernoulli_beta}. If \code{beta_bernoulli_alpha = 1} and
\code{beta_bernoulli_beta = 1}, this means that different configurations of
present or absent diffeences that have the same complexity (number of present
differences) receive the same prior weight. The default is
\code{difference_prior = "Bernoulli"}.}

\item{difference_probability}{The prior probability for a pairwise difference
in the Bernoulli model. Can be a single probability, or a matrix of \code{p} rows
and \code{p} columns specifying the probability of a difference for each edge
pair. The default is \code{difference_probability = 0.5}.}

\item{beta_bernoulli_alpha, beta_bernoulli_beta}{The two shape parameters of
the Beta prior density for the Bernoulli inclusion probability. Must be
positive numbers. Defaults to \code{beta_bernoulli_alpha = 1} and
\code{beta_bernoulli_beta = 1}.}

\item{na.action}{How do you want the function to handle missing data? If
\code{na.action = "listwise"}, listwise deletion is used. If
\code{na.action = "impute"}, missing data are imputed iteratively during the
MCMC procedure. Since imputation of missing data can have a negative impact
on the convergence speed of the MCMC procedure, it is recommended to run the
MCMC for more iterations. Also, since the numerical routines that search for
the mode of the posterior do not have an imputation option, the bgm function
will automatically switch to \code{interaction_prior = "Cauchy"} and
\code{adaptive = TRUE}.}

\item{save}{Should the function collect and return all samples from the Gibbs
sampler (\code{save = TRUE})? Or should it only return the (model-averaged)
posterior means (\code{save = FALSE})? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{display_progress}{Should the function show a progress bar
(\code{display_progress = TRUE})? Or not (\code{display_progress = FALSE})?
The default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{save = FALSE} (the default), the result is a list of class
``bgmNCT'' containing the following matrices:
 \itemize{
   \item \code{gamma}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p} columns,
   containing posterior inclusion probabilities of pairwise differences.
   \item \code{interactions}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p} columns,
   containing model-averaged posterior means of the pairwise associations.
   \item \code{interactions_difference}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{p}
   columns,containing model-averaged posterior means of the pairwise differences.
   \item \code{thresholds}: A matrix with \code{p} rows and \code{max(m)}
   columns, containing model-averaged category thresholds. In the case of
   ``blume-capel'' variables, the first entry is the parameter for the linear
   effect and the second entry is the parameter for the quadratic effect, which
   models the offset to the reference category.
 }

If \code{save = TRUE}, the result is a list of class ``bgmNCT'' containing:
\itemize{
 \item \code{gamma}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
  \code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns, containing the inclusion indicators of the
   pairwise difference from every iteration of the Gibbs sampler.
 \item \code{interactions}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns, containing parameter states from every
   iteration of the Gibbs sampler for the pairwise associations.
 \item \code{interactions_difference}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{p * (p - 1) / 2} columns, containing parameter states from every
   iteration of the Gibbs sampler for the pairwise differences.
 \item \code{thresholds}: A matrix with \code{iter} rows and
   \code{sum(m)} columns, containing parameter states from every iteration of
   the Gibbs sampler for the category thresholds.
 }
Column averages of these matrices provide the model-averaged posterior means.

In addition to the analysis results, the bgmNCT output lists some of the
arguments of its call. This is useful for post-processing the results.

\description{
The function \code{bgmNCT} explores the joint pseudoposterior distribution of
the parameters of a Markov Random Field model for mixed binary and ordinal
variables, group differences in pairwise interactions for a two-sample
design, and indicator variables for these group differences.
}
\details{
The pairwise interactions between variables \eqn{i}{i} and \eqn{j}{j} are
modeled as follows
\deqn{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \eta_{\text{ij}} - \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2,}{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \eta_{\text{ij}} -  \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2,}
in one group and as
\deqn{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \eta_{\text{ij}} +  \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2,}{\sigma_{\text{ij}} = \eta_{\text{ij}} + \delta_{\text{ij}} / 2,}
in the other group. The parameter \eqn{\eta_{\text{ij}}}{\eta_{\text{ij}}}
denotes an overall interaction parameter and is considered to be a nuisance
parameter, and \eqn{\delta_{\text{ij}}}{\delta_{\text{ij}}} denotes the a
pairwise difference parameter, the difference in the pairwise interaction
between the two groups.

Bayesian variable selection is used to model the presence or absence of the
difference in pairwise interactions between the two groups. It imposes a
discrete spike and slab prior distribution on the differences \eqn{\delta_{\text{ij}}}{\delta_{\text{ij}}}.
By formulating it as a mixture of mutually singular distributions, the function
can use a combination of Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling to create a
Markov chain that has the joint posterior distribution as an invariant. The
current option for the slab distribution is a Cauchy with an optional scaling
parameter. Two prior distributions are implemented for the indicator variables
for the pairwise difference parameters (i.e., the prior probability that there
is a pairwise difference); the Bernoulli prior and the Beta-Bernoulli prior.

Currently, \code{bgmNCT} supports two types of ordinal variables. The regular,
default, ordinal variable type has gets its own threshold parameter. The
Blume-Capel ordinal variable assumes that there is a specific reference
category, such as``neutral'' in a Likert scale, and responses are scored
according to their distance from that reference category. Specifically, the
Blume-Capel model specifies the following quadratic model for the threshold
parameters:
\deqn{\mu_{\text{c}} = \alpha \times \text{c} + \beta \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2,}{{\mu_{\text{c}} = \alpha \times \text{c} + \beta \times (\text{c} - \text{r})^2,}}
where \eqn{\mu_{\text{c}}}{\mu_{\text{c}}} is the threshold for category c.
The parameter \eqn{\alpha}{\alpha} models a linear trend across categories,
such that \eqn{\alpha > 0}{\alpha > 0} results in an increasing number of
observations in higher response categories and \eqn{\alpha <0}{\alpha <0}
results in a decreasing number of observations in higher response categories.
The parameter \eqn{\beta}{\beta} models the response style in terms of an
offset with respect to the reference category \eqn{r}{r}; if \eqn{\beta<0}{\beta<0}
there is a preference to respond in the reference category (i.e., the model
introduces a penalty for responding in a category further away from the
reference_category category \code{r}), while if \eqn{\beta > 0}{\beta > 0}
there is preference to score in the extreme categories further away from the
reference_category category.

The pairwise interaction parameters and the category parameters are considered
nuisance parameters that are common to all models. The prior distribution for
the pairwise interaction parameters is a Cauchy distribution with an optional
scaling value. The prior for the exponent of the category parameters is a
beta-prime distribution, which also has two optional scaling parameters.
