\title{Data checks and reformatting for Bayesian graphical models}
\usage{
reformat_data(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{n} by \code{p} matrix containing the binary and ordinal 
variables for \code{n} independent observations on \code{p} variables in the 
network or graph. If not done already, \code{bsl} recodes the variables as 
non-negative integers (i.e., \code{0, 1, ..., m}).}
}
\value{
A list containing the recoded \code{n} by \code{p} matrix \code{x}, 
the vector \code{no_categories} of length \code{p} that specifies for each
variable how many categories it has.
}
\description{
The function \code{reformat_data} does some data checks to see if variables 
do not have exclusively unique observations (e.g., continuous responses) or 
all responses in one category. If one of these situations occur the program
halts immediately and the issue is reported back.
}
\details{
The model and associated software takes in category scores. The levels or 
responses are therefore coded to be consistent with this. The lowest level or
response is therefore coded \code{0}, the next option is coded \code{1}, etc.
Note that response categories that are missing in the data are automatically
collapsed. If the second category is not observed, the third category will be
coded as \code{2}, etc.
