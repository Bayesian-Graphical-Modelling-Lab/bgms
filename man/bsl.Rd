\usage{
bsl(
  x,
  no_iterations = 1e+05,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{n} by \code{p} matrix containing the binary and ordinal 
variables for \code{n} independent observations on \code{p} variables in the 
network or graph. If not done already, \code{bsl} recodes the variables as 
non-negative integers (i.e., \code{0, 1, ..., m}). Unobserved categories are 
collapsed into other categories after recoding.}

\item{no_iterations}{The number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler.}

\item{interaction_prior}{The prior distribution for the interaction effects. 
Currently, two prior densities are implemented: The Unit Information prior
(\code{interaction_prior = "UnitInfo"}) and the Cauchy prior 
(\code{interaction_prior = "Cauchy"}). Defaults to \code{"Cauchy"}.}

\item{cauchy_scale}{The scale of the Cauchy prior for interactions. Defaults 
to \code{2.5}.}

\item{shape1, shape2}{The shape parameters of the Beta-prime prior for the 
thresholds. Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{samples}{Should the function collect and return all samples from the 
Gibbs sampler (\code{samples = TRUE})? Or should it only return the 
(model-averaged) posterior means (\code{samples = FALSE})? Defauls to 
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{display_progress}{Should the function show a progress bar 
(\code{display_progress = TRUE})? Or not (\code{display_progress = FALSE})?
Defauls to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
If \code{samples = FALSE} (the default), a list containing the 
\code{p} by \code{p} matrices \code{gamma} and \code{interactions}, and the 
\code{p} by \code{max(no_categories)} matrix \code{thresholds}. The matrix 
\code{gamma} is a numeric matrix that contains the inclusion probabilities 
for individual edges. The matrices \code{interactions} and \code{thresholds} 
are numeric matrices that contain the (model or structure-averaged) posterior 
means (EAP estimates) of the pairwise associations, and category thresholds, 
respectively. If \code{samples = TRUE}, a list containing the 
\code{no_iterations} by \code{p *  (p - 1) / 2} matrices \code{samples.gamma} 
and \code{samples.interactions}, and the \code{no_iterations} by 
\code{sum(no_categories)} matrix \code{samples.thresholds}. These contain the 
parameter states at every iteration of the Gibbs sampler. Column averages 
offer the EAP estimates.

\description{
The function \code{bsl} explores the joint pseudoposterior distribution of 
structures and parameters in a Markov Random Field for mixed binary and 
ordinal variables.
}
\details{
A discrete spike and slab prior distribution is stipulated on the pairwise 
interactions. By formulating it as a mixture of mutually singular 
distributions, the function can use a combination of Metropolis-Hastings and 
Gibbs sampling to create a Markov chain that has the joint posterior 
distribution as invariant. Current options for the slab distribution are the 
unit-information prior or a Cauchy with an optional scaling parameter. A 
Beta-prime distribution is used for the exponent of the category parameters. 
A uniform prior is used for edge inclusion variables (i.e., the prior 
probability that the edge is included is 0.5).
